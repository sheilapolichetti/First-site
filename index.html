    <h2>Why Sixty6?</h2>
    <p>
        When I was brainstorming names for the brand, I came across this <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/02/how-long-it-takes-to-form-a-new-habit/">article</a>,
        amongst others saying the same thing.
        <br>
        Around 66 days to form a habit. Of course, there was variation in how long habits took to form depending on what people tried to change, <br>
        Whether it was drinking an extra glass of water per day, or taking a 10-minute walk every day, the habits were mostly about adding healthy routines. <br>
         But 66 days. So when I saw that number I just knew. This is what I want to focus on for my vision.
