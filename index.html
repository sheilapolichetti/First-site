    <h2>Why Sixty6?</h2>
    <p>
        When I was brainstorming names for the brand, I came across this <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/02/how-long-it-takes-to-form-a-new-habit/">article</a>,
        amongst others saying the same thing.
        <br>
        Around 66 days to form a habit. Of course, there was variation in how long habits took to form depending on what people tried to change, <br>
        Whether it was drinking an extra glass of water per day, or taking a 10-minute walk every day, the habits were mostly about adding healthy routines. <br>
         But 66 days. So when I saw that number I just knew. This is what I want to focus on for my vision.

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The vision for Sixty6 is founded in the belief that we strive for healthy routines that make everyday life as enjoyable as possible.
        However, starting a habit or routine is not always as easy as it seems. It has become easier and easier for the everyday person to get stuck in habits that are not 
        always the best or most preferred, and more difficult to change this or replace these habits with more sustainable ones.
